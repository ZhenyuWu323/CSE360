### Insert your SERIAL PORT here ###
## may look like "COM5" in windows or "/dev/tty.usbmodem14301" in mac  #
## look in arduino for the port that your specific transeiver is connected to  ##
## Note: make sure that your serial monitor is OFF in arduino or else you will get "access is denied" error. ##
